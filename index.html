    I'm starting to work really hard learning html and it feels seamless.
    I got this genius idea of formatting it!
    As I keep trying to host information such as this through links and folders.

    I'm not looking forward to Monday. I don't know what I am going to do. 
    I patched the prototype ROM of Earthbound_ZERO and transfered it to my "dispositivo" 
    so that'll likely keep me entertained, though, the sunday-monday gap troubles me. The last thing I want is to be bogged down. 
    And that's how I feel I will be. Dammit! Sunday I have covered (for the most part). 
    But Monday is going to be a hassle. In terms of battery consumption and time alotted. 
    Maybe I can re-supply on Monday? Every holiday is like an unwelcomed setback. 
    <br>
    Anyhow, you'd like the ROM. I labeled it "EARTHes.nes"

    I started to watch more VHS rips from the internet archive. 
    It's mostly commercials that I like watching. 
    I'm really stressed about my current financial situation but 
    studying and commercial hypnosis help. I made it to Tuesday. 
    It's a nice day I suppose though I'm riddled with a looming 
    anxiety. Seinfeld is on the VHS rip. George Costanza, and
    Jerry Seinfeld who created it and the cast who star in it-I'm 
    very unfamiliar with. The 100th episode on the rip. It 
    shocks me to a certain extent. It's New York. I'd prefer it 
    if I had family there. The busy atmosphere and the late night 
    ambiance of busy people cramming life's joys through a crappy 
    antenna seems to parallel my other fantasies about life in 
    places like Asia. China, Japan, Korea, or the Philippines.
    Vietnam, Thailand, or even Bangladesh. There's a certain fantasy 
    that plays in my imagination. If you've ever seen Ikiru, Paprika, 
    or Chungking Express.Maybe that can lend you the idea of what I mean
    instead of drafting a person's daily life as in Seinfeld, which is beautiful in its own 
    right. In fact, Merv Griffin whom was covered by Seinfeld
    is number 30 in IMDb's 40 Greatest Late-Night Talk Show Hosts.
    Much like Rufino Tamayo's painting which was dumped in a New York City 
    dumpster the Seinfeld cast find Merv's set in a similar situation. 
    Which makes me question why I hold people in such a favorable light...
